By the end of this article, I’m going to convince you that TI (formerly known as TIP) is the greatest musician and rap artist of our generation.  In order to fully understand the true nature of TI, please also go to TI Spotify and start listening to the sweet sweet sounds of “Whatever you Like”.

I’ll start with just a list of TI’s life achievements, because that alone is impressive.  Through his life, TI has completed 10 studio albums, 1 compilation album, 4 EPs, 110 singles, 1 remix album, 13 mixtapes, and 11 promotional singles.  This is a crazy large amount of musical works he has produced.  And the best part is that he doesn’t just focus on quantity, he also produces a very high level of quality.  Out of the 10 studio albums he made, 7 have received some type and 8 have been within the top 10 on the top 200 US Billboard.  With a median position of 3, a mode position of 1, and an average of 13.3.  Those are crazy numbers, especially the fact that the most common position his studio albums reached is 1.  Not only that but his album “Paper Trail” actually went quadruple platinum.  (Note that none of these numbers even take into account his guest appearances.)

OK, I see your skepticism - I’ve convinced you not only that TI has produced a large amount of music at a high quality, but has he been consistent and has he been able to continue this over a long number of years.  Some claim that TI was just a flash in a pan.  Unfortunately once again you’re wrong.  He released his first debut album in 2001 and is STILL making music.  He’s latest studio album was released last year in 2018 and has been featured on songs into 2019.  That is over 18 years of music making and he’s still not done.  If TI’s first ever album, “I’m serious”, was a person - it would be allowed to vote in our next election. (And yes, this is foreshadowing to his political interests).

So know we’ve spoken about TI’s musical accomplishments, and on spotify you’re probably now just hitting TI’s hit song “Dead and Gone” feat Justin Timberlake.  You might be thinking, “OK Aaron, his a great rapper I get it, but there is so much more to life than just rapping.”  Don’t worry, because on this regard TI has also outshined most people.  In addition to TI’s music career, he has made a career in acting as well.  He has also made an appearance or lead in 17 movies and tv shows.  Some of the movies on this list are such gems as “American Gangster” with Denzel Washington and blockbuster “Ant Man” with Paul Rudd.  These also include several documentaries on Atlanta and TI’s life.  Throughout the 17 appearances he has made, TI has shown skill in both serious and comedic roles, rivaling the careers of many actors who never even touched the music industry.

Further, not only has he been a huge player in pop culture such as music and film, he is also an illustrious entrepreneur.  He has been a part of multiple record labels, owner of a nightclub, launched a clothing company, joined a new music streaming service, and even had an endorsement with Chevrolet at one point.  Even at a young age, TI and his friends would sell mixtapes out of the back of his car.  While TI was dazzling us on both the screen and in our headphones, he was also running businesses on the side.  I can barely talk to my parents on the phone and try to find my car at the same time, much less run a business and produce music.

### The Brass Tax - Why we should pay more attention to TI

And why does all of these music accolades matter?  Why is it such a big deal that TI has done so well?  It’s that he has done all of this and been civically engaged and given back to his community.  TI has been giving back to Atlanta (his hometown) since  the beginning.  Many of his pop culture events have highlighted Atlanta and has re-invested himself into the community, whether through music or business.  He has gotten involved with politics, consistently fighting for social and racial justice.  TI hasn’t just been successful, he has shared his success with those that helped him along the way, his community.  He has used his position of fame to give back to his community.  Has TI made mistakes?  No doubt.  He has gone through a drug conviction, the Hilary Clinton tweet, and more.  But each time he has made a mistake, he has gone out of his way to apologize and make it up to his fans.  TI changed his name from TIP to TI out of respect for the amazing Rapper Q-Tip from the group “A Tribe Called Quest”.  That’s an insanely gracious gesture.  Rebranding yourself halfway through your career out of respect for a fellow artist is a rarity in today’s world.

In a world where it’s hard enough to be successful at one thing, TI has gone ahead and shown hustle and success in most of his life vertices.  And he has done so in a way that holds true to his true morals and beliefs, making sure whatever he does maps back to a core value of his.  He gives back to the community and his fans, and when he makes mistakes he apologizes.  Does he always do the right thing?  No.  **But the point is that he is constantly trying to do something.**   Whether it’s music, acting, business, or civic engagement - TI continues to try and do something to make the world better.  Which is something we can all learn from.  If there’s something we want to see done in the world, don’t let the odds of failure deter you.  It is always better to do something to get us.  

Because in a room full of darkness, an imperfect light will always help you find the door when compared to no light at all.
